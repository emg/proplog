Educational Quiz on Propositional Logic

This is PropLog, an educational tool to teach University students about propositional logic.

It also features a logging back end. Whenever someone (a student, for example) uses the front end tool, questions and answer activity is logged anonymously. This allos the teacher of a course on logic to gain empirical measurements of the level of competence of students in logical argumentation. We have used this for a number of years to test the logic abilities of students before, during, and after a course in basic logic. We have then used this and other feedback in an attempt to improve the course.

PropLog is part of an ongoing research project on improving teaching methods in logic. This research is carried out as a collaboration between the University of Aalborg, Denmark and the Arctic University of Norway, Tromsø. The project is led by Professor Peter Øhrstrøm.
